Act as a Senior Python Engineer. Create a reusable code template and cheat sheet for **[DATA_STRUCTURE]** in a file named `templates/[FILENAME].py`.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Header Docstring**: Include a "Complexity Summary" table listing the Time (O) and Space (O) complexity for common operations like (Access, Search, Insertion, Deletion) based on the data structure.
2.  **Class Structure**: if it is native data structure, keep it is simple and straightforward. If it is a custom data structure, encapsulate the logic in a class named `[ClassName]Patterns`.
3.  **Key Operations**: Implement methods for initialization and all operations on this data structure in different functions.
4.  **Best Practices**: Add comments explaining *when* to use this structure in LeetCode (e.g., "Use Map for O(1) lookups").
**Output Format**: Provide the raw Python code ready to save, with clear comments and docstrings, no printstatements.
