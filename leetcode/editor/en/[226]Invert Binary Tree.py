# Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
# Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: [2,3,1]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. 
#  -100 <= Node.val <= 100
